# Go-CRUDAPI
CRUD Api built from scratch using Go version 1.18.4 (using gorilla/mux)

To test this API, i used POSTMAN (https://www.postman.com/), there you can send the requests to the server in the port 8000, and see the responses.

If you wanna test by yourself: <br>
- Download the repo and extract.
- Enter the folder.
- Run: go build
- Run: go run mnain.go
- The server will be open at port 8000
- To test, you can import the Postman Collection inside the 'Postman Collection' folder (its a .json file) using Postman (https://www.postman.com/).
